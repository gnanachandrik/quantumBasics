#Why I made this?
<br>
I was super curious about quantum computing but found most explanations way too complex. So I decided to learn the basics myself and make notes in a way that makes sense to me. Sharing it here in case it helps anyone else!

<br>
#Spotted a mistake in my report!?
<br>
If you find any typos, have better ways to explain something, or just wanna chat out over quantum stuff (or tech in general), Iâ€™d love to hear from you!
